## Poisson vs Negative Binomial; Offsets; Zero Inflation
- Use **offset** for exposure (e.g., effort, area, time).
- Overdispersion suggests NB; excess zeros may suggest Zero-Inflated models.

```{r}
library(MASS)
set.seed(1)
exposure <- runif(200, 0.5, 2.0)
x <- rnorm(200)
mu <- exp(0.3 + 0.6*x + log(exposure))
y <- rpois(200, mu)
mPois <- glm(y ~ x + offset(log(exposure)), family=poisson())
mNB   <- MASS::glm.nb(y ~ x + offset(log(exposure)))
AIC(mPois, mNB)
```
