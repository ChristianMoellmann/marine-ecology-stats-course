## When & Why GLM?
Use GLMs for non-normal responses (binary, counts) with appropriate links.

### Assumptions
- Correct distribution & link
- Independent residuals (for simple GLMs)
- No severe collinearity among predictors

> **AI Assist:** Ask for a *plain-language explanation* of the logit link; then *verify* by plotting the inverse-logit curve.

```{r}
# Logistic GLM example
library(stats)
df <- data.frame(temp = seq(6, 20, length.out=100))
beta0 <- -5; beta1 <- 0.4
df$p <- plogis(beta0 + beta1*df$temp)
glm_bin <- glm(I(rbinom(100, 1, df$p)) ~ temp, family = binomial(), data = df)
summary(glm_bin)
```
