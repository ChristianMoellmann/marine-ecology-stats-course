# Executive Memo (â‰¤2 pages)

**Design goals:** concept-first, ecology-focused; AI as coach; full reproducibility via renv + Docker + CI.
**Structure:** Quarto book; weekly slides; 7 method assignments; global marine case studies (synthetic data provided here, plug-in real data when ready).
**Assessment:** low-stakes quizzes; rubrics emphasize diagnostics, interpretation, and transparent AI use.
**Reproducibility:** renv.lock (skeleton); Dockerfile; GH Actions CI to render and smoke-test builds.
**Next steps for instructor:** run `renv::restore()`, render book/slides; plug in any real datasets; refine rubrics.
