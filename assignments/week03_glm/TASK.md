# Assignment 1 â€” GLM (Logistic / Counts)

## Task
Fit and interpret a GLM (logistic or Poisson) for species presence or counts. Compare Poisson vs NegBin if overdispersion is suspected; use offsets if modeling rates.

## Data
See `data/` for the CSV files (with a README on variables).

## Deliverables
- R Markdown or Quarto report with code + narrative.
- Model diagnostics (plots and short interpretation).
- Short results + ecological interpretation.
- AI Log attached (see `docs/AI_LOG_TEMPLATE.csv`).

## AI Use Plan
Allowed: code hints, plotting help, debugging messages, summary drafts.  
Required: run and verify all AI-suggested code, cross-check with package vignettes, record in AI Log.  
Prohibited: unverified copy-paste; fabricated references.

## Starter
Open `starter.Rmd` and follow the steps.
